<h3>Dr. Suess': How the grinch Stole Christmas</h3>

<p>
    A great family/children's movie around the holidays. Jim Carrey's acting in this movie
    is one for the ages and this movie has always stuckw ith me as a favorite.
</p>

<h3>Chicken Little</h3>

<p>
    A fun and silly movie for children/families. A great movie about coming up in the world
    and developing into your own person while also being able to lean on those closest to you,
    even when the times get tough. Fantastic 'coming of age movie.'
</p>

<h3>Dr. Suess': The Cat in the Hat</h3>

<p>
    Another wacky and silly movie for children and families. Similar to 'Chicken Litte,' this movie
    is keen on showing kids that there needs to be balance of emotions in your life. Sometimes its time
    laugh and play, other times its time to be a bit more serious. Great 'coming of age' style movie.
</p>

<h3>Madagascar</h3>

<p>
    A movie that really shows the true power and value of friendship. Even though the four main animals
    have different individual qualities and quirks, they find a way to always remain together and consider 
    each other family, even through the highs and the lows. Wholesome movie for family/children.
</p>

<h3>Like Mike 2: Streetball</h3>

<p>
    A more 'modern' installment in the 'Like Mike' series, the second Like Mike tale gives the viewer a good mix
    of comedy, drama and action. Yet again, a fantastic 'coming of age' tale about a boy who learns that his life 
    is much more pure and fun when he commits to the things he loves purely out of that love.
